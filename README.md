# Boragó Certificate on GitHub Pages

This repository hosts my certificate of completion from [Boragó](https://borago.cl) – ranked #23 on **The World’s 50 Best Restaurants** list.

## How to View

Once GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository, visit:

```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```

The page displays the certificate image and provides a link to download the PDF version.

It also showcases a photo of the *Erizo* (sea urchin) dish I worked on at Boragó.
